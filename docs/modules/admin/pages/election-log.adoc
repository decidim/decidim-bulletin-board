= Election log

At every point of an election, anybody can check the status of the election from its public page via the Election Log.

The election log can be accessed from the Voting's menu in the public page.

It details every step of the election lifecycle in the Bulletin Board, specifically:

* Election creation;
* Key ceremony;
* Voting period;
* Tally;
* Results publication.

It also provides instruction on how to verify the election results once the election results have been published.

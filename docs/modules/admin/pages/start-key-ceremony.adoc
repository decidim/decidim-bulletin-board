= Start the Key Ceremony

As an administrator of Decidim, you can start the Key Ceremony for an election.

The Key Ceremony is the process that gathers the Trustees of an election to create the encryption keys in the Bulletin Board.

All the trustees need to be connected at the same time to perform the Key Ceremony, so some coordination is needed.

You can kick off the ceremony by clicking `Start the key ceremony` in the election steps.

Now the Trustees can access the Trustee Zone and create the encryption keys.

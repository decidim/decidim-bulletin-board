= Count votes and create closure certificate

When a Polling Station closes, the Polling Station President or one of the Managers have to report in Decidim the results of the election for their Polling Station, so that this can be taken into account in the total tally.

This can be done from the Polling Officer Zone.

== Count votes

To report the recount of the ballots, a Polling Station Officer (the President or one of the Managers) will have to click on `Count votes` for the relevant election displayed in their Polling Officer Zone.

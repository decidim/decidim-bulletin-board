Click on `Generate identification keys` to proceed.

This will start a process in your browser that creates a private-public key pair and downloads the private identification key.

It is fundamental for the security of the election to scrupulously follow the steps to store the private identification key.

Once you are sure the private key is stored safely, you can proceed to submit the public key to the server by hitting `Submit`.

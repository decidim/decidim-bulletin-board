= Validate the election results

The role of the Monitoring Committee is to verify that both physical and online elections ran smoothly and are valid.

SpecificallyIn the specifics, Monitoring Committee Members can:

* Validate the Polling Stations election closures created by the Polling Station Officers;
* Validate the online election using the validation utility;
* Preview the final results of the election.

== Access the Election

Monitoring Committee Members are appointed by Decidim admins as explained in https://www.notion.so/Create-and-configure-a-Voting-7d8c12536de448d38d00718430860762[the corresponding section].

When a Decidim is a Monitoring Committee Member for a Voting, they will gain access to the admin panel for that specific Voting.

They can access the admin area from the user menu.
In the backoffice area, they will only have access to the Voting they are a Monitoring Committee Member for, unless their user also has other kind of admin access.

=== Validate Certificates

The Monitoring Committee Members can see and validate the https://www.notion.so/Count-votes-and-create-closure-certificate-376a0f16ca0f4cbf85174204c37802b0[electoral closures created by the Polling Station Officers when closing a Polling Station].

The Monitoring Committee Member will see the list of Polling Stations and the status of the electoral closure.

`Signed?` indicates whether the Polling Station Officers created&signed the electoral closure for their Polling Station, `Validated?` indicates if any member of the Monitoring Committee has validated the electoral closure.

Two electoral closures were created and signed, but non of them has been validated yet.

Clicking on the `Validate` action the Monitoring Committee Member can review the closure and validate it.

The Monitoring Committee Member will be able to see, on the same page, the physical election closure certificate for the Polling Station, the results submitted to the Bulletin Board by the Polling Station Officers and the notes to the Monitoring Committee by the Officers.

The Monitoring Committee Member can report incidences before validating the Polling Station closure certificate.

Once a certificate has been validated, the Monitoring Committee Members can view it but not edit it anymore.

== Verify the online elections

The online election is handled by the Bulletin Board, which provides a way to verify that all the operations were carried out smoothly and without any kind of tampering.

After closing the election, the Bulletin Board will publish a file for the election on which the Monitoring Committee can run the verification tool.

The Bulletin Board provides a verifiable election file to run the verification of the election.

Download the file for the election you want to verify.
For extra security, the Monitoring Committee should make sure that the checksum of downloaded file corresponds to the one of the file on the server.

We can then proceed to run the verifier on the downloaded file.

The verifier is included in the Bulletin Board repository linked in the instructions.
Cloning it and running the specified command we can verify if any incident happened in the online election.

== Validate results

The `Validate results` provides the Monitoring Committee a preview of the final results of the election.
This will only be available after the Trustees have https://www.notion.so/Perform-the-tally-832de66242a54c259643e021fe03bc5b[performed the tally].

On the top part there is a summary of the total number ballots with the detail by valid/blank/null.

Below is reported the detailed results by question.

Notice that all values are reported for Polling Stations (physical election), Bulletin Board (online election) and total.

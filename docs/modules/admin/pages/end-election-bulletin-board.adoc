= End the election in the Bulletin Board

Once the election's end time is reached, the admin will be able to tell the Bulletin Board to stop accepting votes for the election in question.

This can be done by clicking on `End voting period` in the election's `Manage steps` section.

As per the xref:admin:start-election-bulletin-board.adoc[voting period start], if the rake task `decidim_elections:scheduled_tasks` is set up as a recurrent task in your Decidim installation, this will be done automatically after the election has ended.

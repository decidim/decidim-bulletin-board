The Key Ceremony is one of the main pieces that guarantees the security and the anonymity of the election.

In this process the Trustees create the encryption keys used to encrypt the votes during the voting period and decrypt the results at the end of the election.

As a Trustee, you can take part to the Key Ceremony by xref:admin:create-trustee-identification-keys.adoc[accessing the Trustee Zone in your account page].

When the administrator of the election has started the Key Ceremony, you will see that an action is required for the election you are a Trustee for.

Now click on `Perform action` to enter the Key Ceremony view.

Notice that _all the Trustees need to be connected at the same time in order to perform hte Key Ceremony_.

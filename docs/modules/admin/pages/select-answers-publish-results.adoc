= Select answers and publish results

The election voting period is over, the Trustees performed the tally and the Monitoring Committee validated the election and the results.

It is now time for the Decidim admin to select the prevailing answers that will be shown as winners of the election and to publicly publish the results.

== Select answers

When the admin accesses the election's `Manage steps` section, they will now see the calculated results.

Notice that the answers with the highest number of votes have the value highlighted in green, but for the moment all of them are marked as 'Not selected'.

When the admin knows what answers they want to select, they will need to head to the `Manage questions` section of the election.

It is now time to make them publish in Decidim.

Hitting `Publish results` will make the results of the election public and visible from the election's public page.

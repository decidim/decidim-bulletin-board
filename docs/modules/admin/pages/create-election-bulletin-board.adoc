= Create an Election in the Bulletin Board

At this point, with the election created in Decidim, the Voting all set up and the Trustees identified and created in the Bulletin Board, we can create the election in the Bulletin Board.

From the admin panel, navigate to the election in your participatory space.

Click on the `Manage steps` icon to see if the election is ready to be sent to the Bulletin Board.

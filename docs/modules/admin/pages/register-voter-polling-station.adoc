= Register a voter in the polling station

During the voting period, a Polling Station Officer (President or Manager) can mark that a voter has voted in the Polling Station they are assigned to from the Polling Officer Zone.

When a voter comes to the Polling Station and identify themselves with an ID, the Polling Station Officer should do the following operations in Decidim:

* Verify that the voter is in the Census;
* Check what ballots the voter can cast;
* Mark the voter has voted.

This last operation implies that:

* The voter will not be able to vote physically from other Polling Stations;
* The voter will not be able to vote online;
* Any previous ballot casted online will be spoiled.

== Access the Polling Officer Zone

After a xref:admin:create-voting-decidim.adoc[Decidim admin made a user a Polling Officer] and assigned them to a Polling Station, the user will be able to access the Polling Officer Zone and see their Polling Stations.

The Polling Officer Zone can be accessed by Presidents and Managers from their account page:

== Check if a voter is in the census

When a person comes to the Polling Station, the Polling Station Officer will need to ask for an identification document to check if they are in the census and what ballots they can cast.

The Polling Station Officer will have to click on `Identify a person` on the corresponding election to proceed with the identification.

Filling in the form with the data from the identification document provided by the voter, the Polling Station Officer can validate that the voter is in the census.

. if the voter already voted online, a disclaimer saying "the participant has already voted online"
 ** The voter can still vote in person, but the Polling Station Officer should warn the voter that this will spoil the ballot they casted in the online election.
. the list of questions the voter is entitled to answer

When the participant has deposited their ballot(s) in the ballot box, the Polling Station Officer can  tick the `The participant has voted` checkbox and hit `Complete voting`.
⚠️ WARNING: this will complete the voting procedure for the voter and prevent them from voting again in this election, both physically and online.

After a short processing period, during which the Bulletin Board is notified that the voter has voted physically, the Polling Station Officer will be able to register a new voter.

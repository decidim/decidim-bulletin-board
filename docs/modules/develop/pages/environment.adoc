= Development environment

To start working with the Bulletin Board you will need to install all the dependencies for the server. These are explained in the https://github.com/decidim/decidim-bulletin_board/blob/main/README.md[README file of the web application]. This server will include test data that can be used by Decidim or the elections sandbox to test the different parts of the system.

Also, this application includes Visual Studio Code Dev Containers to simplify the environment setup.

= Deployment

To deploy the Bulletin Board in a production environment, there are some extra precautions we need to take.

== Infrastructure

The Bulletin Board server is a Ruby on Rails application.
Apart for the server stack, we will need to set up:

* `Postgresql` as database;
* `Redis` - used by Sidekiq.

== Docker

The Bulletin Board server is https://hub.docker.com/r/decidim/decidim-bulletin-board[published in Dockerhub] as a Docker container.

If you want to deploy a modified version of the Bulletin Board, we highly recommend to use `Dockerfile.web` in the root folder of the repository to build and release the application.

== ActiveStorage

The Bulletin Board uses ActiveStorage.
You will need to set it up with the credentials of the cloud storage of your choice in `bulletin_board/server/config/storage.yml`, taking the secrets from environment variables.

== Environment Variables

We'll need to set up an array of environment variables in order for the sever to function correctly.

* Rails:
 ** `RACK_ENV` and `RAILS_ENV` with value `production`;
 ** `RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES` with value `true`;
 ** `SECRET_KEY_BASE`.
* Connect to Postgres:
 ** `DATABASE_URL` with the full URL of the database;
* Redis:
 ** `REDIS_URL` with the full URL of the Redis instance;
* ActiveRecord:
 ** The secrets of the cloud storage of your choice;
* CORS:
 ** `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOWED` with the list of hosts of Decidim instances that will use this Bulletin Board.
If you don't know what Decidim instances will use this Bulletin Board, you can put `*`

== SSL certificate

To be able to use some advanced cryptography features, both the Bulletin Board as Decidim should be served using HTTPS and a valid SSL certificate.

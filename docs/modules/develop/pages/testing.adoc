= How to test the Bulletin Board

The Bulletin Board is composed of several parts, so there are different tests suites for each part:

* The Rails app has a suite of unit and integration tests for the API server.

* The client gem has a suite of integration tests, mocking the server responses.

* The client JS library also has its own test suite to test the trustee and voter components behaviour.

* Each voting scheme has its own integration tests to ensure that the trustee, voter and bulletin board wrappers work well together.

== Testing end to end integration

The development application includes a sandbox that can be used to test all the parts working together. This application is used by automated tests to perform holistic integration tests.

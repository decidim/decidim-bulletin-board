= Environment Variables

We try to let most of the things defined through Environment Variables, as https://12factor.net/config[12factor applications's config]. You'll need to configure them through your hosting provider (for example in Heroku), through a gem like `figaro` or through docker-compose `env_file`.

.Decidim Bulletin Board Env Vars
|===
|Name |Value

|DATABASE_URL
|Connection string for the Postgres database

|IDENTIFICATION_PRIVATE_KEY
|The Bulletin Board private key, in JWT format. It should at least include the keys `kty`, `n`, `e`, `d`, `p`, `q`, `dp`, `dq` and `qi`.

|RAILS_ENV
|Environment for Ruby on Rails. If it's on your local machine for development, then it should be `development`. If it's on server it should be `production`. Please take care that this has security implications. You DON'T want to run a production application in development mode.

|RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT
|If true it will show the log contents on the shell Standard Out. It's especially relevant for certain hosting providers (for example, Heroku or Docker). It's also part of https://12factor.net/logs[12factor's recommendations].

|SECRET_KEY_BASE
|Secret key base for the Application. It's specially important that this is kept secret from the outside word; do NOT publish it on GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket.

|RAILS_LOG_LEVEL
|Log level for the application. Defaults to `info` (possible values are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` and `fatal`).

|IAT_EXPIRATION_MINUTES
|Expiration time for the JWT tokens, in minutes. Defaults to 60 minutes.

|HOURS_BEFORE_CREATE_ELECTION
|Number of hours before the election starts that the election can be created. Defaults to 1 hour.

|SEED
|Used to force seed test data on production environments, if `true`.

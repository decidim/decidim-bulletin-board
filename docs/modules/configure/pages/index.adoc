= Configuring

Decidim is a Ruby on Rails application, and as such we try to follow their conventions. Please read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html[Configuring Rails Applications].

Just as a reminder, these files are important:

* config/database.yml
* config/secrets.yml
* config/storage.yml

== Configuring cloud storage

By default, the bulletin board will store files, such as verifiable election logs, on disk. This is not advisable, and you should edit `config/storage.yml` to configure a cloud storage provider such as Amazon S3. Follow instructions at https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#setup to do so.

You can change most of these settings through xref:configure:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables].

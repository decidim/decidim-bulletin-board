= Configuring

Decidim is a Ruby on Rails application, and as such we try to follow their conventions. Please read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html[Configuring Rails Applications].

Just as a reminder, these files are important:

* config/database.yml
* config/secrets.yml

Although most of these settings you can change them through xref:configure:environment_variables.adoc[Environment Variables].

= Decidim Bulletin Board Developer Documentation

== What's this?

This is the internal Decidim Bulletin Board documentation.
If you want to see it in a nice UI you can do it at the https://docs.decidim.org/bulletin-board/[Decidim Bulletin Board Documentation Site].

== How this works?

This is made with https://antora.org/[Antora].
It uses https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] mark-up document format.
It's pretty similar to Markdown, although it's more standarized and can do more complex things.
Read more about https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-vs-markdown/[Markdown vs AsciiDoc].

If you want to convert from Markdown to AsciiDoc:

. online pandoc conversor or
. using kramdoc:

[source,bash]
----
gem install kramdown-asciidoc
kramdoc --format=GFM --output=your-doc.adoc --wrap=ventilate your-doc.md
----

The nice thing about Antora is that you can have multi-repositories for your documentation, so we have some technical sections in this repository and in the Decidim repository (like Install and Develop) and other sections that are not for developers or system administrators on the https://github.com/decidim/documentation[other repository].
